# Python-Project-for-Facial-Detection-and-Facial-Recognition-Software
This is the facial recognition system which I have built for obtaining Bachelor of Science Honors in Computer Science at the University of Fort Hare. This project works very well and it ensures multimedia database indexing, content-based image retrieval and also image registration. This project has been written using Spider python 3.8
